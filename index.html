          <h1><strong>PyGame</strong> Library</h1>
          <p>Pygame is a cross-platform set of Python modules designed for writing video games. It includes computer graphics and sound libraries designed to be used with the Python programming language.</p>
          <p>Pygame is built over the Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) library, with the intention of allowing real-time computer game development without the low-level mechanics of the C programming language and its derivatives.</p>
          <p>Pygame applications can run on Android phones and tablets with the use of Pygame Subset for Android (pgs4a). There is no way to run Pygame applications on iOS.</p>

          <h2>I use <strong>Python</strong></h2>
          <p>Python is a widely used high-level programming language for general-purpose programming. Python features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management and supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative, functional programming, and procedural styles. It has a large and comprehensive standard library.</p>
          <p>Python interpreters are available for many operating systems, allowing Python code to run on a wide variety of systems. CPython, the reference implementation of Python, is open source software and has a community-based development model, as do nearly all of its variant implementations. CPython is managed by the non-profit Python Software Foundation.</p>

          <h2><strong>Space</strong> Pix <strong>Invaders</strong></h2>
          <p>Space Invaders is an arcade video game created by Tomohiro Nishikado and released in 1978. It was one of the forerunners of modern video gaming and helped expand the video game industry from a novelty to a global industry.</p>
          <p>The aim is to defeat five rows of ten aliens that move horizontally back and forth across the screen as they advance toward the bottom of the screen. The player defeats an alien, and earns points, by shooting it with the laser cannon. As more aliens are defeated, the aliens' movement and the game's music both speed up.</p>
          <p>The aliens attempt to destroy the cannon by firing at it while they approach the bottom of the screen. If they reach the bottom, the alien invasion is successful and the game ends. A special "mystery ship" will occasionally move across the top of the screen and award bonus points if destroyed.</p>
